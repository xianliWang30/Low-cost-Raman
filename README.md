# Low-cost-Raman
here are some files for constructing Low-cost-Raman-Microscope
You can find the control code of the system in the 'Phython code.zip' file. Every one can easily realize the automation of the system using the code.
You can found the DIY parts of the system in 'stl2.zip'. Everyone can print those parts.
And the cost and the URL of the system can be found in 'Price_list.xlsx' file. 
Hopefully everyone can easily replicate this system
